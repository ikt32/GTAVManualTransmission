## Game requirements

* Grand Theft Auto V (build 1604+)
* [ScriptHookV by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)

## Downloads

* [GTA5-Mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/manual-transmission-ikt)
* [GitHub releases](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission/releases)

## Building requirements

* Visual Studio 2022
* [DirectX SDK (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) for XInput 1.3 ([see doc](doc/notes.md))

The solution builds two files:

* `Gears.asi`, the actual script. This goes in Grand Theft Auto V's root folder.
* `WheelSetup.exe`, which is a companion program for debugging wheel inputs. Can also write configurations.

## Scripting API  

Some convenience functions are exposed by the script.

Check [ManualTransmission.h](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission/blob/master/Gears/ManualTransmission.h) for available API functions.

* [C# Example](https://gist.github.com/E66666666/d11cdbd9800ad73efeff612374349347)
* [C++ Example](https://gist.github.com/E66666666/59390733b366cad4638901ae5fcfd046)
